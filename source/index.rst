Welcome to the Legion Manual
############################

The `first paper <https://legion.stanford.edu/pdfs/sc2012.pdf>`_ 
describing the Legion programming model was published in 2012.
Since then, there has been enormous progress and many people 
have contributed to the project. Throughout this period new application 
developers have learned Legion through a combination of examples, lore 
from other members of the project, research papers and reading the 
source code of the Legion implementation.  The intention here is to put 
down in a systematic fashion what a programmer who wants to use
Legion to develop high performance applications needs to know.
